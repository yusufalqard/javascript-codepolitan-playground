// There is logical expression in javascript
// Operator Comparison are commonly used by developer
// Here an example how to use it
let calculation = 1 > 2;
// let calculation = 1 < 2;
// let calculation = 1 >= 2;
// let calculation = 1 <= 2;
// let calculation = 1 == 2;
// let calculation = 1 != 2;
// let calculation = 1 === 2;
// let calculation = 1 !== 2;
console.log(calculation);
// Enable/Disable each code comparison to see the result
// For documentation, you can access by visit this link https://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0000.pdf
// You can also do comparison not just numeric, but also string, conditional, etc

// Double and Triple equal mostly used for comparison of value
// Here an example how to use it
A = 3 == '3';
console.log(A);
B = 3 === '3';
console.log(B);
// Difference between double and triple equal is double equal only compare the value not the data type
// While triple equal compare the value and the data type
// Logical decision sometimes can be difficult to understand how to make our program works
// But with practice study case and experience by doing from failure, bug, error, etc
// Your code will much better later on

// Most common javascript code for debug
// There is log(), alert(), warn(), error(), prompt(), confirm(), etc
// Here an example how to use it
console.log('This is logging');
console.warn('Warning');
console.error('Error');
prompt('Fill this message below');
confirm('Are you sure?');
// Use browser console to see the result with open html file in browser i was provide in this folder
