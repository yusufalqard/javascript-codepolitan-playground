// There is Constants and Variables in JavaScript
// Their fundamental difference is that Constants cannot be changed, while Variables can be changed
// Let function is used to declare Variables, while Const function is used to declare Constants

// Example of Constants
const YourScore = 90;
// YourScore += 1;
// YourScore -= 1;
// YourScore *= 1;
// YourScore /= 1;
console.log(YourScore);
// Result are 90 even though there are 4 math operations, const function cannot be changed or modified
// Enable/Disable the code above to see the result with Quokka.js
// There is an error message that says "TypeError: Assignment to constant variable." in each math operation
