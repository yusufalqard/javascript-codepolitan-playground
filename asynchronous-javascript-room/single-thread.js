// Single Thread on Asynchronous Javascript
// Single Thread are program that only run process one request at time

// Example code
const newTask = input.value; // Get user input from task input
sendToServerAndSaveIt(newTask); // Input take process a while depends how many process taken by server
input.value = ''; // Will process after save data

// Example logic of your daily life in morning routine

// 1. Wake up morning from bed
// 2. Strectching your body after wake up for 5 minutes
// 3. Preparing Food and Drinks materials for cooking
// 4. Prep a bread, choco nutella jam and knife then combine all ingredients
// 5. Prep a oven bread and set auto-off timer for 10 minutes
// 6. Prep kettle and fresh water then cook in gas stove for 3 minutes, set on high flames
// 7. Prep a Tea Sachet and Sugar
// 8. Put all ingredients in big glass drink
// 8. Turn off gas stove, pour hot water from kettle to glass drink
// 10. Mix all ingredients until everyting dissolve
// 11. Keep it outdoor for 4 minutes in table and prep towel, tooth paste, soap, and shampoo into bathroom
// 12. Go wash yourself at bathroom for 7 minutes while your hot tea on cooling
// 13. Use towel after bath then find your clothes
// 14. Back to your kitchen, then prep a plate and take your cooked bread from oven
// 15. Place those nearby with your tea glass drink
// 16. Sit on chair and enjoy your breakfast meal

// See how many process taken of this logic in real life
// Everything was done in order same like Single Thread does in Asynchronous Javascript
// If we want use this logic into code, you can actually do it.
// Asynchronous function can help during build code process
